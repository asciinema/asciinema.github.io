__asciinema__ is a suite of tools for recording, streaming, and sharing
terminal sessions. It is free and open-source software (FOSS), created by
[Marcin Kulik](https://hachyderm.io/@ku1ik).

Its typical use cases include creating tutorials, demonstrating command-line
tools, live coding, and sharing reproducible bug reports. It focuses on
simplicity and interoperability, which makes it a popular choice among computer
users working with the command-line, such as developers or system
administrators.

    To get deeper, navigate to the [manual](manual/index.md), which covers
    installation, configuration and usage of each asciinema component
    ([CLI](manual/cli/index.md), [player](manual/player/index.md),
    [server](manual/server/index.md)). It also includes the specification of the
    [file format](manual/asciicast/v2.md) used by asciinema.

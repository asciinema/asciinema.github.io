# agg - asciinema gif generator

__agg__ is a command-line tool for generating animated GIF files from terminal
session recordings.

It supports conversion from [asciicast v2](../asciicast/v2.md) files produced by
[asciinema recorder](../cli/index.md). It uses Kornel Lesi≈Ñski's excellent
[gifski](https://github.com/ImageOptim/gifski) library to produce optimized,
high quality GIF output with accurate frame timing.

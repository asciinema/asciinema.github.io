# asciinema server

__asciinema server__ is a server-side component of the asciinema ecosystem.

It implements a hosting platform for terminal session recordings and live
streaming. It offers a familiar web interface for viewing, browsing, sharing
and managing recordings and streams. This includes [HTTP API](api.md), which is
used by the [asciinema CLI](../cli/index.md).

The server is built with [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org/) and
[Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). It embeds asciinema's
virtual terminal, [avt](https://github.com/asciinema/avt), which is utilized by
tasks such as preview generation, recording analysis and live stream state
bookkeeping.

[asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org) is a public asciinema server instance
managed by the asciinema project team, providing free hosting for terminal
recordings and streams, available to everyone. Check
[asciinema.org/about](https://asciinema.org/about) to learn more about this
instance.

You can easily [self-host asciinema server](self-hosting/index.md) and use the
[asciinema CLI](../cli/index.md) with your own instance. If you're not
comfortable with hosting your data at asciinema.org, if your company policy
prevents you from doing so, or if you simply prefer self-hosting everything,
then asciinema has you covered.

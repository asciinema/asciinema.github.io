# asciicast v1

asciicast v1 is a file format for terminal sessions recorded by [asciinema
CLI](../cli/index.md) 1.x.

It's based on [JSON](https://www.json.org/).

The format describes terminal metadata, such as initial terminal size,
timestamp, etc, and a list of timed output (terminal write) events that were
captured during recording session.

asciicast v1 file looks like this:

``` json
{
  "version": 1,
  "width": 80,
  "height": 24,
  "duration": 1.515658,
  "command": "/bin/zsh",
  "title": "",
  "env": {
    "TERM": "xterm-256color",
    "SHELL": "/bin/zsh"
  },
  "stdout": [
    [
      0.248848,
      "\u001b[1;31mHello \u001b[32mWorld!\u001b[0m\n"
    ],
    [
      1.001376,
      "I am \rThis is on the next line."
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Attributes

Every asciicast v1 includes the following set of attributes:

* `version` - must be set to 1,
* `width` - terminal width, i.e. number of columns,
* `height` - terminal height, i.e. number of rows,
* `duration` - total duration of the recording, as a floating point number,
* `command` - recorded command, as given via `-c` option to `rec`, optional,
* `title` - title of the recording, as given via `-t` option to `rec`, optional,
* `env` - map of environment variables, usually includes `TERM` and `SHELL`,
* `stdout` - array of "frames", see below.

## Frames

Frame represents an event of printing new data to a terminal. It is a 2 element
array containing **delay** and **data**.

**Delay** is the number of seconds that elapsed since the previous frame (or
since the beginning of the recording in case of the 1st frame) represented as a
floating point number, with microsecond precision.

**Data** is a string containing the data that was printed to a terminal in a
given frame. It has to be valid, UTF-8 encoded JSON string as described in [JSON
RFC section 2.5](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt), with all non-printable
Unicode codepoints encoded as `\uXXXX`.

For example, frame `[5.4321, "foo\rbar\u0007..."]` means there was 5 seconds of
inactivity between previous output and `foo\rbar\u0007...`.
